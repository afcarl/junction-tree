"""Belief propagation, junction trees etc

General guidelines:

- Use functional approach:

  - pure functions (no side effects)

  - immutable data structures

  - prefer expressions over statements (e.g., if-else expression rather than
    if-else statement)

- Provide functions as a library so that users can use only some functions
  alone without needing to use the full stack

- Try to keep the implementation such that it would be possible to use, for
  instance, TensorFlow or Theano for the library. Not a thing to focus now
  but just something to keep in mind.

- Write tests comprehensively, preferably before the actual implementation
