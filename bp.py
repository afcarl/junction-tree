"""Belief propagation, junction trees etc

Everything in this file is just rough sketching and ideas at the moment.
Probably many things will change when implementing and learning.


Factor graphs:
--------------

A factor graph is given as a list of keys that tell which variables are in the
factor. (A key corresponds to a variable.)

[keys1, ..., keysN]  # a list of N factors

The index in the list can be used as an ID for the factor, that is, the first
factor in the list has ID 0 and the last factor has ID N-1.

A companion list (of numpy arrays) of the same length as the factor list is
provided as a representation for the factor values

[values1, ..., valuesN]

Also, the size of each of the M variables can be given as a dictionary:

{
    key1: size1,
    ...
    keyM: sizeM
}

Here, size is an integer telling the size of the variable. It is the same as
the length of the corresponding axis in the array later.

No moralization function should be needed.


Generic trees (recursive definition):
-------------------------------------

[index, keys, child_tree1, ..., child_treeN]

The index can, for instance, refer to the index of the factor?


Junction trees:
---------------


[index, keys, (separator1_keys, child_tree1), ..., (separatorN_keys, child_treeN)]


Junction trees:

[
    index, keys
    (
        separator1_index, separator1_keys
        child_tree1
    ),
    ...,
    (
        separatorN_index, separatorN_keys
        child_treeN
    )
]

Potentials in (junction) trees:
-------------------------------

A list/dictionary of arrays. The node IDs in the tree graphs map
to the arrays in this data structure in order to get the numeric
arrays in the execution phase. The numeric arrays are not needed
in the compilation phase.


Idea:

Junction tree construction constructs a function which can then be used
multiple times to create the junction tree for particular array values in the
factor graph. This allows one to compile the junction tree only once and then
use the result for varying values in the factors (but with the same graph
structure, obviously). That is, the junction tree construction depends only on
the factor graph structure and the array shapes, but not the values in the
arrays.

General guidelines:

- Use functional approach:

  - pure functions (no side effects)

  - immutable data structures

  - prefer expressions over statements (e.g., if-else expression rather than
    if-else statement)

- Provide functions as a library so that users can use only some functions
  alone without needing to use the full stack

- Try to keep the implementation such that it would be possible to use, for
  instance, TensorFlow or Theano for the library. Not a thing to focus now
  but just something to keep in mind.

- Write tests comprehensively, preferably before the actual implementation
